# Image Classification with ResNet-50 in Matlab  

This Matlab project uses ResNet to classify images into the following categories: electric guitar, brain, and laptop. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-50 model to extract image features, which are later used to train a classifier. This was my first experience with Matlab, and it was a great way to see a functional convolutional neural network (CNN) in action without getting into the complex underlying mathematics. The project helped me abstract the knowledge of deep learning models while also learning basic Matlab functions, such as working with image datastores, data augmentation, and feature extraction.
